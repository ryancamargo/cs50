## Description

The Password Manager project is a comprehensive web application designed to securely manage passwords and sensitive credentials. Built using Python, Flask, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and SQLite, it offers users a convenient and secure platform to store, generate, and manage their passwords.

### Features

1. **User Registration and Login:** Users can create accounts by providing a username, email, and password. Once registered, they can log in securely using their credentials.

2. **Password Generation:** The application includes a password generator tool that allows users to create strong, randomized passwords based on their preferences, such as length and character types.

3. **Credential Storage:** Users can securely store their credentials, including website or application names, usernames, and passwords. All stored credentials are encrypted to ensure maximum security.

4. **Profile Management:** Users have the ability to update their profile information, including email and password, to maintain accurate account details.

5. **Password Expiry Notifications:** The application sends notifications to users when stored passwords are nearing expiration or have not been updated for a certain period. This feature helps users stay proactive in managing their passwords.

6. **Access Control and Permissions:** Role-based access control is implemented to restrict certain actions to specific user roles. Administrators can manage user roles and permissions as needed.

7. **Data Backup and Recovery:** Users can export their stored credentials to a file for backup purposes. Additionally, the application includes a data recovery feature to restore previously backed-up data if needed.
